## Getting Started: Your First Ad

For your first time, you'll be prompted to select a **Gemini API Key**. This is required for the app to generate content. If you need to generate a video, ensure your selected key is associated with a project that has billing enabled.

Once your key is selected, you're ready to create!

## The Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

Creating a great ad is a simple 4-step process.

### Step 1: Write a Visual Prompt

In the **Visual Prompt** box, describe the image or video you want the AI to create. Be descriptive!

*   **Good:** `A golden retriever puppy wearing tiny glasses, sitting in a library, looking at the camera.`
*   **Needs Improvement:** `dog`

### Step 2: Choose Your Platform & Ad Style

First, select the social media platform you're creating the ad for (e.g., TikTok, Instagram Post). The app will automatically use the correct aspect ratio.

Next, choose an **Ad Style**. This powerful "Creative Finisher" step determines how your text overlays will look on the final image.

### Step 3: Generate and Edit Creative Suggestions

Click the **"Generate Test Ideas"** button. The AI will generate three complete ad concepts for you, each with:
*   **Hook:** A catchy headline to grab attention.
*   **Key Messages:** The main body text of your ad.
*   **CTA (Call to Action):** What you want the user to do (e.g., "Shop Now," "Learn More").

**Important:** You can, and should, **edit this text directly** in the suggestion cards to perfectly match your brand's voice. Click on any text to change it.

### Step 4: Generate Your Content

Click **"Generate Image"** or **"Generate Video"**.

The app will generate a visual and create versions of it paired with the text from *each of the three* suggestion cards. 
*   **For Images:** The text and selected style are **burned directly into the image**. What you see is exactly what you download.
*   **For Videos:** The text will appear when you hover over the video in the preview.

The results will appear in the main content area. Click the download icon to save your ad-ready assets.

## Feature Deep Dive

### Creative Finisher: Ad Styles
This is the final step that makes your assets look authentic and native to each platform. This feature currently applies only to images.
*   **Polished:** Uses clean, bold fonts for a professional, high-production feel.
*   **Native TikTok:** Mimics the look of text edited directly in the TikTok app, complete with a subtle "shaky-cam" effect.
*   **UGC/Testimonial:** Simulates a user-generated content screenshot, perfect for displaying reviews or testimonials in a trustworthy format.

### Video Generation Controls
You can optionally provide a **Start Image** and/or an **End Image** for video generation. This gives you more control over the final video, allowing you to create "Midjourney-style" transformations.

## Best Practices
*   **Be Specific:** The more detail you give in your prompt, the better the visual output.
*   **Match Style to Platform:** Use the "Native TikTok" style for TikTok, and the "UGC/Testimonial" style for platforms where authentic reviews perform well, like Instagram or Facebook.
*   **Test Everything:** Use the generated variations to run A/B tests. Test different hooks, visuals, and styles to see what drives the best results.

Happy creating!

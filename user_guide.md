## Getting Started: Your First Ad

For your first time, you'll be prompted to select a **Gemini API Key**. This is required for the app to generate content. If you need to generate a video, ensure your selected key is associated with a project that has billing enabled.

Once your key is selected, you're ready to create!

## The Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

Creating a great ad is a simple 4-step process.

### Step 1: Write a Visual Prompt

In the **Visual Prompt** box, describe the image or video you want the AI to create. Be descriptive!

*   **Good:** `A golden retriever puppy wearing tiny glasses, sitting in a library, looking at the camera.`
*   **Needs Improvement:** `dog`

### Step 2: Choose Your Platform

Select the social media platform you're creating the ad for (e.g., TikTok, Instagram Post). The app will automatically use the correct aspect ratio for your chosen platform.

### Step 3: Generate and Edit Creative Suggestions

Click the **"New Ideas"** button. The AI will generate three complete ad concepts for you, each with:
*   **Hook:** A catchy headline to grab attention.
*   **Key Messages:** The main body text of your ad.
*   **CTA (Call to Action):** What you want the user to do (e.g., "Shop Now," "Learn More").

**Important:** You can, and should, **edit this text directly** in the suggestion cards to perfectly match your brand's voice. Click on any text to change it.

### Step 4: Generate Your Content

Click **"Generate Image"** or **"Generate Video"**.

The app will generate one piece of media (an image or a video) and create versions of it paired with the text from *each of the three* suggestion cards. This gives you multiple ad variations to test instantly!

The results will appear in the main content area. You can hover over each one to see the text overlays and click the download icon.

## Feature Deep Dive

### Creative Suggestions
This panel is your AI marketing assistant. Use the "New Ideas" button to brainstorm, then refine the text in the cards to get it just right. The generated content will always use the three suggestions currently displayed and edited by you.

### Video Generation Controls
You can optionally provide a **Start Image** and/or an **End Image** for video generation. This gives you more control over the final video, allowing you to create "Midjourney-style" transformations.

## Best Practices
*   **Be Specific:** The more detail you give in your prompt, the better the visual output.
*   **Brainstorm and Refine:** Use the AI to generate ideas, but use your expertise to refine the final copy in the suggestion cards.
*   **Test Everything:** Use the generated variations to run A/B tests on your chosen platform. Test different hooks, messages, and visuals to see what drives the best results.

Happy creating!
